#  Financial Data Visualization - Power BI & Python

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on the financial analysis of 10 major companies using historical stock market data. By combining **Python** for data extraction and **Power BI** for visualization, this dashboard provides clear insights into market trends, price fluctuations, and trading volumes.

##  Key Implementation Details
As part of this project, I implemented several advanced techniques to ensure data accuracy and visual clarity:

- **Automated Data Extraction**: Used the `yfinance` library in Python to pull real-time and historical stock data.
- **Python Integration in Power BI**: Wrote and integrated Python scripts directly within Power BI to handle complex data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.
- **Dynamic ETL**: Leveraged **Power Query** to transform raw time-series data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
- **Advanced DAX Measures**: Developed custom DAX expressions to calculate key metrics, including moving averages and percentage changes.

##  Tech Stack
- **Power BI Desktop**: Data modeling and dashboard creation.
- **Python (Pandas, yfinance)**: Data extraction and manipulation.
- **DAX**: Advanced calculations and measures.

##  Repository Structure
- `data/`: Raw data files extracted from Yahoo Finance.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts used for the ETL process.
- `Financial_Analysis.pbix`: The source Power BI file.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

##  How to View the Project
1. **Directly**: Download the `.pbix` file and open it with **Power BI Desktop**.
2. **Screenshots**: If you don't have Power BI installed, you can browse the `screenshots/` folder to see the final results.
